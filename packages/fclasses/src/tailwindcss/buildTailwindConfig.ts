 * any classes used at pacakge level are not purged.
 *
 * > Note: Modules are exported from `@bodiless/fclasses` using ES module syntax,

 * Options to use when creating the tailwind config.

 * @example ** Site level tailwind.config.js **
 *
 * ```js
 * const requireEsm = require('esm')(module);
 *
 * const { buildTailwindConfig } = requireEsm('@bodiless/fclasses');
 *
 * const twConfig = {
 *  // ...include your own tailwind configuration here.
 *  // (be sure to add a `content` section to prevent purging of any classes used in your site).
 * };

 * module.exports = buildTailwindConfig({
 *   twConfig,
 *   resolver: (pkgName) => require.resolve(pkgName),
 *   // Ensure that site-level config takes precedence over packages.
 *   prefer: ['@sites/--minimal--'],
