# Search Overview

Vital Search is based on [BodilessJS Search](../../bodiless/Components/Search) component. It adds 
features and styles specific to VitalDS sites.

> Vital Search re-export everything Bodiless Search does. This means that, if you're using Vital
> Search, you can simply import anything from Bodiless Search using `import { something } from '@bodiless/vital-search`
> instead. This way, you don't have to depend on both `@bodiless/search` and `@bodiless/vital-search`.
